\title{Calculate Simple Basal Area}
\usage{
ba_simple(data, n_focal, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the tree data, including columns such as `latin` (species name), 
`gx`, `gy` (coordinates), and `ba` (basal area).}

\item{n_focal}{An integer specifying the number of focal trees to include in the calculation.}

\item{r}{A numeric scalar for the radius parameter. This parameter represents the maximum distance 
to consider when summing basal areas of neighboring trees.}
}
\value{
A list with two numeric vectors:
\describe{
  \item{`con_ba`}{A numeric vector representing the cumulative basal area of conspecific trees within the radius.}
  \item{`total_ba`}{A numeric vector representing the cumulative basal area of all trees (conspecific + heterospecific) within the radius.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the total basal area (conspecific + heterospecific) for a given set of tree data,
focusing on the number of focal trees and a radius parameter. The basal area represents the cumulative 
cross-sectional area of tree trunks adjusted for a simple decay model.
}
\details{
The function applies a simple decay model where the basal area contribution of each tree decreases
  proportionally with its distance from the focal tree:
  \deqn{\text{decayed basal area} = \frac{\text{ba}}{\text{dist}}}
  where `dist` is the Euclidean distance from the focal tree to its neighbors.
}
\examples{
# Generate a sample dataset
sample_data <- data.frame(
  latin = sample(letters[1:4], 100, replace = TRUE),
  gx = runif(100),
  gy = runif(100),
  ba = runif(100, 10, 30)
)

ba_simple(sample_data, n_focal = 10, r = 1.5)
