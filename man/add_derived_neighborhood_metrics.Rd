\title{Derived neighborhood metrics}
\usage{
add_derived_neighborhood_metrics(summary_tbl)
}
\arguments{
\item{summary_tbl}{A data frame produced by `neighborhood_ba()` or a similar
structure containing `con_ba`, `total_ba`, `con_count`, and `total_count`.}
}
\value{
The same data frame augmented with:
* `prop_con_ba` – proportion of basal area contributed by conspecifics,
* `het_ba` – heterospecific basal area,
* `het_count` – heterospecific neighbor count,
