\title{Calculate Basal Area with Decay Function}
\usage{
ba_decay(mu_values, sp, gx, gy, ba, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu_values}{A numeric vector of decay parameters. Each value in `mu_values` represents
a decay factor that modifies how the basal area contribution diminishes with distance.}

\item{sp}{A character vector containing species names for each tree.}

\item{gx}{A numeric vector of x-coordinates for the trees.}

\item{gy}{A numeric vector of y-coordinates for the trees.}

\item{ba}{A numeric vector of basal area values for the trees.}

\item{r}{A numeric scalar representing the radius to consider for neighboring trees.}
}
\value{
A list with two matrices:
\describe{
  \item{`con_ba_matrix`}{A numeric matrix of basal areas with decay applied for conspecific (same species) trees.}
  \item{`total_ba_matrix`}{A numeric matrix of basal areas with decay applied for all trees (conspecific + heterospecific).}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the basal area across a given set of trees, applying a decay effect
based on distance and species identity for each tree within a given radius.
}
\details{
The function applies an exponential decay model where the basal area contribution
  diminishes with distance from the focal tree:
  \deqn{\text{decayed basal area} = \text{ba} \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\text{dist}}{\mu}\right)}
  where `mu` is the decay parameter, `ba` is the basal area, and `dist` is the Euclidean distance
  between trees.

  This approach allows the analysis of how tree proximity (distance-decay) and species identity
  affect the distribution of basal area in an ecological setting.
