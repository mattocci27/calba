Description: Fast C++-backed tools for computing conspecific and total neighborhood basal area in mapped forest plots. Includes unweighted and distance-weighted neighborhoods, multiple radii, decay kernels, and basic edge correction. Outputs are model-ready covariates for forest competition, growth, and survival models, following neighborhood modeling workflows commonly used in spatial ecology (e.g., H{\"u}lsmann et al. 2024 <doi:10.1038/s41586-024-07118-4>).
