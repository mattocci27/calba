Description: Provides fast C++-backed functions to compute conspecific and total neighborhood basal area for every tree in mapped forest plots. Supports unweighted and distance-weighted neighborhoods, multiple radii, and alternative decay kernels (exponential and exponential-normal), along with simple edge-correction options. The resulting neighborhood metrics are designed as model-ready covariates for competition, growth, and survival models in forest dynamics and spatial ecology studies, and integrate naturally with standard R modeling workflows.
